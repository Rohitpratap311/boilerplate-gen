This is a basic API for a todo application made with Springboot. You can use any frontend framework with this. This project uses SQL in this project. Other databases can also be used easily.

- Get all the todo items present in the database, send a get request on the following endpoint:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/todos
```

- To post a todo item in the database, send a post request on the following endpoint:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/todos
```

- To update a specific todo item as completed/pending, send a put request on the following endpoint:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/todos/<todoItemID>
```

- To delete a specific todo item, send a delete request on the following endpoint:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/todos/<todoItemID>
```

- To delete all todo items, send a delete request on the following endpoint:

```

For further details, you can refer to <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Spring-Boot</a>. Also, as a prerequisite, you'll need to have maven 3.x and SQL pre-installed on you system. And as an SQL action, create a DB and change <a href="https://github.com/Aerothon-NTP/boilerplate-gen/blob/main/backend/Springboot/src/main/resources/application.properties">Application.properties</a> file accordingly.
